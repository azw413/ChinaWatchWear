# ChinaWatchWear

An open source Android app to support the many MediaTek MT2502(A/B/C) based watches ('Aster' platform). 

Primary functionality will be :-

1. Pair a watch to the phone / app.
2. Push all app notifications to the watch. 
3. Manage notifications e.g. accept 'Block' requests coming from the watch and provide Android UI to manage blocked and pushed app notifications.
4. Synchronise step count to show current count. 
5. Capture step count by hour and display a bar chart for current day.
6. Push step count to Google Fit
7. Synchronise heart rate data and show last reading.
8. Schedule periodic readings e.g. hourly etc
9. Push to Google Fit
10. Support sport activities e.g. a walk, a run and push these to Google Fit
11. Push and install VXP apps to the watch and allow uninstall.

No spyware, all open source, and only permissions required to deliver the service. If a user declines a permission then the app still works but without that function.
